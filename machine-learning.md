# What is Machine Learning
Getting Computers (Machine) to learn without being explicitly Programmed.

> or

Getting Computers (Machine) to recognize patterns by examples, rather than programming it with specific rules. These patterns are found within Data

“A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some class of tasks T and performance measure P, if its performance at tasks in T, as measured by P, improves with experience E.” — Tom Michel

Example-1:
Suppose your email program watches which emails you do or do not mark as spam, and based on that learns how to better filter spam. What is the task T in this setting?

1. Classify emails as spam or not spam.
2. Watching you label emails as spam or not spam.
3. The number (or fraction) of emails correctly classified as spam/not spam.
4. None of the above, this is not a machine learning algorithm.

* Label emails as spam or not spam (option-2) is the Experience (E)
* Classify emails as spam or not spam (option-1) is the Task (T)
* The number (or fraction) of emails correctly classified as spam/not spam (option-3) is the Performance (P)

Example-2: 
Playing checkers.
* E = the experience of playing many games of checkers
* T = the task of playing checkers.
* P = the probability that the program will win the next game.

# Categories of Machine Learning Algorithms
In general, any machine learning problem can be assigned to one of two broad classifications:
* Supervised learning
* Unsupervised learning
* Others : Reinforcement learning, Recommender Systems
