# Bloom Filter 

Bloom Filter is a memory-efficient, compressed probabilistic data structure that we can use to answer the question of whether or not a given element 
is in a set.

Bloom filters requires very less memory. It only answers yes or no queries as opposed to Hash tables where the find operation can retrieve the whole record
